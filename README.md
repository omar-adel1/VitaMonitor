## Description
In critical medical situations such as those in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), timely and accurate monitoring of patients is crucial to ensure optimal healthcare outcomes. Hypotension, a condition characterized by a decrease in blood pressure and an increase in heart rate, is one such critical case where immediate intervention is necessary. In such cases, administering medication through an intravenous (IV) cannula is often required. However, with medical personnel already overloaded with responsibilities in the ICU, a comprehensive system that can seamlessly integrate patient monitoring and medication delivery becomes essential.

Introducing **VitaMonitor+**: A Revolutionary Patient Care Solution

To address the challenges faced by medical professionals in the ICU, we proudly present **VitaMonitor+** - a cutting-edge system designed to monitor patient heart rate and deliver medication through infusion, while simultaneously providing real-time alerts to medical personnel. This advanced system combines accuracy, efficiency, and seamless integration to enhance patient care and support medical staff in critical situations.

## Components
The VitaMonitor+ system consists of the following components:

1. Arduino board
2. Pulse sensor module
3. 9V battery
4. LCD display (16x2 or similar)
5. Buzzer
6. LED (any color)
7. Relay module
8. Jumper wires
9. Breadboard or prototyping board
10. Resistors (220 ohms or similar)

## Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to set up the VitaMonitor+ system:

1. Connect the Arduino board to the computer using a USB cable.
2. Install the Arduino IDE from the official website (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
3. Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
4. Connect the components according to the provided circuit diagram.
5. Upload the code provided in the "VitaMonitor.ino" file to the Arduino board.
6. Connect the 9V battery to power the system.
7. The LCD display will show the patient's heart rate, and the buzzer will sound an alert if the heart rate exceeds a certain threshold.
8. The LED will indicate the status of the medication delivery system, controlled by the relay module.
9. Monitor the patient's heart rate and ensure the medication delivery is functioning properly.

## Usage
To use the VitaMonitor+ system, follow these instructions:

1. Ensure that the system is properly set up as described in the Installation and Setup section.
2. Power on the VitaMonitor+ system by connecting the 9V battery.
3. The LCD display will show the patient's heart rate in real-time.
4. If the heart rate exceeds the set threshold, the buzzer will sound an alert.
5. Monitor the LED status to ensure the medication delivery system is functioning correctly.
6. Take necessary medical intervention if alerted or as per the monitoring results.
7. Regularly check and maintain the system's components to ensure optimal performance.
